## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (with Drizzle ORM)
- **Deployment**: Replit, Netlify (serverless functions)

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.x or higher
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DevResourceHub.git
   cd DevResourceHub
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

### Deployment to Netlify

This project is set up for easy deployment to Netlify with serverless functions for the backend API.

1. **Prepare for deployment**:
   ```bash
   # Build the application and prepare Netlify functions
   ./scripts/deploy-to-netlify.sh
   ```

2. **Deploy using Netlify CLI**:
   ```bash
   # Install Netlify CLI if you haven't already
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   
   # Login to your Netlify account
   netlify login
   
   # Initialize Netlify site (first time only)
   netlify init
   
   # Deploy to Netlify
   netlify deploy --prod
   ```

3. **Manual Deployment**:
   - Fork or clone this repository to your GitHub account
   - Login to your Netlify account and click "New site from Git"
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - The build settings will be automatically configured from the netlify.toml file:
     - Build command: `bash ./scripts/netlify-build.sh` (handles all build steps)
     - Publish directory: `dist`
   - Configure environment variables in the Netlify UI
   - Deploy!

4. **Environment Variables**:
   Configure the following environment variables in the Netlify UI:
   - `NODE_ENV`: Set to `production`
   - `DATABASE_URL`: Your PostgreSQL database connection string (if applicable)
   - Any other API keys or secrets required by your instance
